Here's a professional README file for your Brain Tumor Detection Streamlit application:

Brain Tumor Detection App
Overview
The Brain Tumor Detection App is a web-based application developed using Streamlit and Keras, designed to assist in the early detection of brain tumors from MRI images. By leveraging a trained deep learning model, this app provides users with the capability to upload MRI scans and receive immediate predictions regarding the presence of tumors.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for uploading MRI images.
Image Processing: Automatically resizes and normalizes images for optimal model input.
Real-Time Predictions: Instant feedback on whether a tumor is detected in the uploaded image.
Visual Display: Displays uploaded images and prediction results clearly.
Requirements
To run this application, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Streamlit
Keras
NumPy
Pillow
Install Dependencies
You can install the required dependencies using pip. Create a virtual environment for better package management:

bash
Copy code
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install streamlit keras numpy Pillow
Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Ensure that you have the pre-trained model file (Brain Tumor detection.g9) in the same directory as the app script.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the application.

Upload an MRI image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG format) and receive the prediction.

Model Details
The application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of MRI images for binary classification (tumor vs. no tumor). The model predicts the presence of a brain tumor based on the input MRI image.
